#DRIVE SAFE

##Problem

In today's world, passing vehicles in traffic, especially for a cyclist to pass a double-decker bus, has still being dangerous. Not paying proper attention could cause very disappointed results. While warnings on roads may help in this situation, a software written using Computer Vision and Machine Learning theories comes up to promising better results.

##Goal

The project “Drive Safe” is an application which recognises pre-defined object (bicycle in my case) from a dashboard camera of a vehicle and instantly informs a driver about this object. Main goal behind this project is to find a solution for making driving more secure by understanding and developing Computer Vision and Machine learning algorithms. Researching principles and algorithms to make the software as accurate and as fast as possible is another important challenge in the project.

##Solution

“Drive Safe” uses computer vision algorithms, and artificial intelligence techniques for classification data provided by a camera. Some external libraries like OpenCV are used during the development.
